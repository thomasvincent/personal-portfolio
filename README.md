# Thomas Vincent's GitHub Profile

## Overview

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Thomas Vincent, a DevOps engineer with a passion for software development. As part of my 2023 New Year's resolution, I've set a goal to update all of the repositories in my GitHub account to the latest versions of Chef, Puppet, Terraform, Python, Ruby, Golang, and Java. But I don't just want to update the code - I also want to make it more efficient and maintainable. To achieve this, I plan to apply SOLID and DRY to code that follows the principles of DevOps. This means simplifying the code, reducing redundancy, and ensuring that each component of the codebase has a clear and specific purpose. By doing this, I hope to make the code more scalable, easier to maintain, and ultimately more valuable to the community.
